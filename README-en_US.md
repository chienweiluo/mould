# Mould

[简体中文](./README.md) | English

Mould is an experimental project that helps designers and engineers achieve autonomy on their respective sides by establishing an interface between GUI and Code.

In anticipation, Mould can solve the following problems that are hard at this moment:

-   Designers and engineers restrict each other
-   It's difficult to test GUI program
-   Localization challenges
-   Design system

## Usage

Architect defines skeleton -> Designer fills with flesh -> Programer injects magic
